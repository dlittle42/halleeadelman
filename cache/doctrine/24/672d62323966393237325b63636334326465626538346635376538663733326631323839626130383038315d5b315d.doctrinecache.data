<p>When I develop characters or prepare to revise a manuscript, I often stop writing and turn to other forms of art.  I’ve found that switching arts helps me either dig deeper on the “feelings level” or stay connected to my story. </p>
<p>While crafting characters for my recent teen novel, <em>Frayed</em>, I signed up for a local drawing class. I’m not an artist, so there was no pressure to create “good work.” For me, this was key. It allowed me to simply explore. When I saw models or still-life, I focused on feelings, and I drew.  Here are some of my pieces: </p>

<strong><em>Using fashion magazines and charcoal, this piece helped me think through my main character: her pain, her fear, and ultimately her strength.</em><br />

<strong><em>This drawing allowed me to channel Milo, a character suffering from addiction. I used a heavy hand to represent her intensity and drew the crumbled bags to show how she felt on the inside. </em></strong></p>

<strong><em>This charcoal drawing brought to life one of the characters telling her story in an Al-Anon meeting that my main character attends. </em></strong></p>

<strong><em>This piece represents my main character’s mentor. I wanted to show the point when the mentor couldn’t continue to go with Hope on her journey. I used pastels and charcoal. </em></strong></p>
<p>As authors, we hold so much our heads about our stories. When I needed to step away before revising <em>Frayed</em>, I stayed connected to the story through music. I began a “Fraylist” or playlist to represent the events or emotions in my chapters or theme-songs for my characters.  For example, I chose “BREATHE ME” by Sia for one scene where Milo admits that she’d been relapsing. Listening back to the playlist gives me an emotional starting point when I return to the writing. </p>
<p>During my last break from the story, I went one step further. I wrote my own music and song lyrics to capture the pain of watching someone struggle from addiction. The song is called Round and Round. I even recorded a demo with the help two musicians I know. I will be posting the demo and more about this experience in another post. </p>
<p>Unpressured art experiences provide a vulnerability that help to deepen a story. Whether it’s drawing, song writing, photographing, pottery painting, or set building, I’ve found that writing can be fueled by engaging in all forms of art. </p>
<p><strong>Special thanks to my amazing art teacher:</strong></p>
