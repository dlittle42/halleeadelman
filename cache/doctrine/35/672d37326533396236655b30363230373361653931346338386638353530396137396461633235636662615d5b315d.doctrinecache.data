Nope.<br />
Not even going to reread it.<br />
Make a change.<br />
Fix a spahlling mistake.<br />
Even the ones I make on purpose<br />
to make myself laugh.<br />
Because today, one of my former elementary school students<br />
Tweeted me a compliment.<br />
In fact, he called me amazing.<br />
And I wondered.<br />
Am I? Amazing?<br />
I mean, am I embodying<br />
The amazing qualities<br />
That I would wish<br />
For my former students?<br />
Because I sure wish a lot for them.<br />
In fact, I wish them everything.<br />
But as a writer<br />
I can think and rethink<br />
Perfect and overperfect<br />
Visit and revisit<br />
To the point where I am<br />
Not just emoting<br />
And expressing<br />
But<br />
I am erasing…<br />
What I shouldn’t erase.<br />
And frankly, sometimes<br />
That makes things turn out to be<br />
Not so amazing.<br />
Not the everything<br />
that I wish<br />
for my former students.<br />
But despite all that<br />
This student still said<br />
He thought I was<br />
Amazing.<br />
As his former teacher…<br />
I can only promise<br />
that I sure am gonna try to be.<br />
But if I try and still get it wrong<br />
I'll smile anyway<br />
Because I know<br />
that my former students<br />
will get it "write"<br />
’Cause there’s no stopping them!<br />
There never was!<br />
And I'm certain they’ll even be able to<br />
Correct my mizztakes.<br />
And live without erasing<br />
Too<br />
Much.<br />
Talk about amazing…</p>
<p>Dedicated to MS and my former students who continue to inspire me. </p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
