After Hallee posted the article "Writing to Scream" about a talented young woman's heroin overdose, readers exclaimed, "I'm screaming with you!" This led Hallee to create the first Community Scream Night at Linwood Park with Hummingbird Recovery Yoga to raise awareness about issues related to mental health and addiction facing kids/teens. Attendees colored their screams, screams facts about mental health & addiction and participated in scream yoga.
